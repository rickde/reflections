How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the 
bug that was introduced?

Using diff reduces the amount of text I needed to visually search through
and comparing the code from the two versions on consecutive lines quickly
exposed the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a
more efficient programmer in the long term?

Often your first attempt at solving a problem is your most enlightend 
approach and can clarify the original goal of a project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros are you save in logical expressible periods of your work flow 
that you and others can later understand. the cons we all forget to save
 and could loss our hard earned work due to system failure.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
 multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
 file separately?

Git is designed for coder writing code using multiple interrelated files.
 Google docs is designed to handle a single doc of multiple sizes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using
 Git for?

I set my workspace up as instructed in the course and I'm looking forward 
to using Git with my current xCode project.
