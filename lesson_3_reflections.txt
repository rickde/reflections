When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To work with a group of developers or to make the project available to the public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to be sure the changes are ready to share before pushing them to GitHub.
